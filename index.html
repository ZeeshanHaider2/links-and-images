      Assignment(Main HTML project): For presentation make a few page
      presentation website about your
      <strong>hobby/favorite books/movies etc</strong>. Your website should
      contain a homepage with a link to go inside to the page where your
      material should be presented in list form, with links leading to pages
      with the description(text & image) of your chosen subject. As an added
      bonus, you can make each list element into a link, leading to the page
      where additional information about said subject can be found(images are
      always welcomed, just don't over do it :D)
